# Polka Play - A Staking Game

## Overview

Welcome to **Polka Play**, an engaging staking game built on the Polkadot network! This project offers a fun and competitive way for players to interact with native DOT cryptocurrency. It's a simple, head-to-head game where both participants put a small amount of DOT on the line, with the winner taking home the lion's share.

## How it Works

2.  **Winner Takes All (Almost):** The winner of the game receives `0.19` DOT, making for an exciting high-stakes experience.
3.  **Leaderboards:** Track your progress and see how you stack up against other players on the integrated leaderboards. Compete for the top spot and earn bragging rights!
