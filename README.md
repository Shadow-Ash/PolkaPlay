Polka Play - A Staking Game
Overview
Welcome to Polka Play, an engaging staking game built on the Polkadot network! This project offers a fun and competitive way for players to interact with native DOT cryptocurrency. It's a simple, head-to-head game where both participants put a small amount of DOT on the line, with the winner taking home the lion's share.

How it Works
Stake to Play: To start a game, both players stake 0.01 native DOT (Polkadot's cryptocurrency).
Winner Takes All (Almost): The winner of the game receives 0.19 DOT, making for an exciting high-stakes experience.
Leaderboards: Track your progress and see how you stack up against other players on the integrated leaderboards. Compete for the top spot and earn bragging rights!
Features
Decentralized Staking: Securely stake DOT for gameplay directly on the Polkadot blockchain.
Competitive Gameplay: Engage in one-on-one matches with clear stakes and rewards.
Global Leaderboards: See real-time rankings of top players and strategize your way to the top.
Asset Security: Your digital assets remain exclusively yours; no third parties have access to them.
